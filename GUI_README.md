## Usage Tips

1. **File Selection**: Use the "Browse" buttons to select audio files or directories
2. **Analysis**: Click "Analyze" buttons to start processing (may take time for large files)

4. **Export**: Use the Export Tools tab to save results in your preferred format
5. **Status Bar**: Check the bottom status bar for current operation status

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+O**: Open file (in file selection dialogs)
- **Ctrl+S**: Save (in export dialogs)
- **Esc**: Close dialogs

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify tkinter is available (usually included with Python)

### Analysis Takes Too Long
- Large audio files take longer to process
- Use batch analysis for multiple files
- Check the status bar for progress

### No Visualizations Appearing
- Ensure matplotlib is properly installed
- Check that analysis completed successfully
- Try resizing the window

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- All dependencies from requirements.txt
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Sufficient RAM for large playlists (recommended: 4GB+)

## Notes

- The GUI runs analysis in background threads to keep the interface responsive
- Large playlists may take several minutes to analyze
- Export formats are optimized for compatibility with popular DJ software
