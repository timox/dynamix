# DynaMix

**DynaMix** is an advanced audio transition analysis tool designed for DJs and music enthusiasts to ensure smooth and energetic transitions between tracks. By analyzing the RMS (Root Mean Square) energy levels, BPM, musical key, and other audio features of MP3 files, DynaMix helps you identify the optimal mixing points so that the energy flow on the dance floor remains consistent.

   git clone https://github.com/makalin/dynamix.git
   cd dynamix
   ```

2. **Install the Required Python Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install FFmpeg (if not already installed):**

   - **FFmpeg Download:** [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Alternatively, you can use package managers like `apt`, `brew`, or `chocolatey` depending on your OS.

## 🎵 Usage

### Basic Two-Track Analysis

Run the original DynaMix tool for basic energy analysis:

```bash
python mix_analiz.py path/to/track1.mp3 path/to/track2.mp3 --gecis_suresi 10 --threshold_factor 1.2
```

### Enhanced Analysis

Use the enhanced version for comprehensive analysis:

```bash
python mix_enhanced.py track1.mp3 track2.mp3 --visualize
```

### Playlist Analysis

Analyze entire music collections:

```bash
python mix_enhanced.py --playlist /path/to/music/folder --set-duration 90 --visualize
```

### DJ Performance Tools

Generate DJ notes for individual tracks:

```bash
python dj_tools.py track.mp3 --export dj_notes.txt --visualize
```

Batch analyze entire directories:

```bash
python dj_tools.py --batch /path/to/music/folder --output-dir /path/to/notes
```

### Graphical User Interface

Launch the GUI application:

```bash
python gui.py
```

The GUI provides access to all DynaMix features through an intuitive interface.

### Energy Level and Set Ordering

Each track gets an **energy level from 1 to 10**. It is computed on the loudness-normalised
body of the track, so a quiet master and a loud master of the same tune get the same level.
The components are the tempo, the number of percussive events per second, the share of
percussive energy, the share of low end and the brightness; the tempo and rhythm terms only
count when the track actually has a beat, so pads and ambient pieces stay low.

Set lists (`create_set_list`, `--playlist`, GUI "Create Set List") first pick tracks that cover
the whole energy range of the folder for the requested duration, then place them along the
chosen curve (`build`, `wave`, `peak_middle`, `constant`) while keeping neighbours within a few
BPM and harmonically compatible (Camelot-wheel logic: same key, relative major/minor, fifth
neighbours).

### Mastering Check and Pre-master Pass

Badly mastered collections make automatic transitions sound uneven even with ReplayGain, which
only fixes the average level. `mastering.py` measures every track like a mastering engineer and
can write corrected copies (the originals are never touched):

```bash
# Report: loudness (LUFS, ITU BS.1770), loudness range, true peak, clipping, DC offset,
# tone balance, stereo phase (L/R correlation, bass phase, mono compatibility, comb filtering)
python mastering.py check /path/to/music
python mastering.py check my_set.m3u --json report.json

# Corrected copies: loudness normalised to -14 LUFS, true-peak limited at -1 dBTP, DC removed,
# polarity/bass phase repaired, optional tone matching to the set's median balance
python mastering.py fix /path/to/music --out /path/to/music_premastered --tone
python mastering.py fix my_set.m3u --out out_dir --lufs -12 --format flac
```

Flags are set-relative where it matters ("darker than the rest of the set", "quieter than the
rest of the set") so that the goal is a consistent set, not an abstract reference. Comb
filtering cannot be repaired automatically (it needs the original stems); it is only reported.
No FFmpeg needed: decoding and encoding go through soundfile/libsndfile (WAV, FLAC, OGG, MP3).
In the GUI: Playlist Manager tab, **Mastering Report** and **Pre-master Set...**. The transition
sheet ("Plan Transitions" / `mixxx_export.py`) includes a track-by-track synthesis with the same
measurements, and can be saved as JSON.

### Transition Planning and Mixxx Auto DJ

Plan every transition of a set and push the result into [Mixxx](https://mixxx.org) so that
its Auto DJ mixes the whole playlist by itself:

```bash
# Analyze a folder, build a set list, print the transition sheet, write cues + playlist into Mixxx
python mixxx_export.py --playlist /path/to/music --set-duration 60

# Keep the order of an existing playlist and save the sheet
python mixxx_export.py --m3u my_set.m3u --sheet transitions.txt

# Plan only (no Mixxx) / preview what would be written
python mixxx_export.py --m3u my_set.m3u --no-mixxx
python mixxx_export.py --m3u my_set.m3u --dry-run
```

For each track DynaMix computes a beat-aligned **intro** section (where it should start under
the previous track, until its energy kicks in) and an **outro** section (where the previous
track should start fading, until it must be gone). They are written as Mixxx intro/outro cues
and a Mixxx playlist is created with the set order. In Mixxx, add that playlist to the Auto DJ
queue and pick the **Full Intro + Outro** transition mode. The tracks must already be in the
Mixxx library and Mixxx must be closed during the export; a backup of `mixxxdb.sqlite` is made
first. The same is available in the GUI: Playlist Manager tab, **Plan Transitions**, then
**Export to Mixxx**.
